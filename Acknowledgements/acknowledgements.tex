\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I thank my considerate supervisor Prof. Dr. Bender. Without him, Prof. Dr. Ochs, and Prof. Dr. Schuster, I would not have been able to write my thesis in the first place. I thank Prof. Dr. Fuchs and Prof. Dr. Eschmeier, to whom I owe my modest knowledge of calculus as the result of their instructive lectures and exercises. Last but not least, I thank my supportive family and friends that have patiently endured my bad temper while I was working on my thesis, or possibly, a little longer already.
