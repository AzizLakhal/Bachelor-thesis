\chapter*{Literature}

The problem considered throughout this thesis was borrowed from Zhou and Yong \cite{zhou}. Bardi's and Capuzzo-Dolcetta's book \cite{bardi2008optimal} proved an excellent reference to get acquainted with the fundamental principles of optimal control, related to viscosity solutions. Barles' lecture notes are a valuable resource illustrating a wide variety of uniqueness arguments with respect to their area of application.
