\chapter*{Outlook}

We finally present two optimality conditions for optimal controls. The first one is necessary, and given a smooth value function, even sufficient. The second one is sufficient, and allows us to verify that a given control is indeed optimal. Both involve the global comparison result \ref{Viscosity Uniqueness}.
